              <span role='img' aria-label="Smiley" >ðŸ˜€ </span>,
              and is seeking to find the opportunity to work in a fun and challenging working environment that will encourage me
               to improve and learn new and necessary skills.I love adventures & taking risks so every second I search for a new thing 
               to do which will help me open up for new opportunities as well as teach me new ideas about life. I am someone who is
                consistently growing themselves and who takes the
                time to continue learning and keep improving myself. I take responsibility for my actions and when things go wrong
                 I donâ€™t look to outside forces to blame, rather Iâ€™m someone who looks at where I can improve upon the next time 
                 around. Pointing fingers solves nothing <span role='img' aria-label="sadtype">ðŸ˜… </span>. I am committed 
                 to building something larger, and someone who puts aside personal gain for the well-being of the group. besides
                  that,  I also love to contribute to open source ;) In the end, 
                  I am on a journey to never stop learning <span role='img' aria-label="correct" >âœ”</span>. </h2>
